## About the Project

Customer churn prediction is critical for businesses to retain customers. This project focuses on using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to predict whether a customer will churn based on historical data.

**Key Features:**
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering
- Building and training an ANN model using TensorFlow
- Evaluating model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
